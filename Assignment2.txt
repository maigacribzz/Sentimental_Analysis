As John snuck up on his wife, he was as quiet as a mouse. Salley is a daisy and everybody likes her. She had been married to John for five years.  Marriage is a journey, but marriage to John is more exciting than most. Life with John was nothing if not exciting. But life wasn't a beach for the two.

They had a great dog, Max, but death like a thief stole Max at a snail's pace.  Max made many memorable moments, making them miss him in a multitude of melancholy moments of malaise. Max once pulled the couple out of bed during a house fire, so the two could get to safety before the house became engulfed in flames. 

Yes, life is a fickle mistress for the young couple, but they soldier on. As John reaches out to startle Salley, she turned with the garden hose dousing him in water. Life ain't a peach, but the were as happy as a pig in mud.
